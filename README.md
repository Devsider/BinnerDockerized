# Binner
Binner is a free open-source parts inventory tracking system you can run locally in Windows or Unix, or for free online at [Binner.io](http://binner.io). It was created for makers (like myself), hobbyists or electronic engineers to keep track of your local parts inventory.

* Automated part lookup on Digikey
* Flexible search engine
* Export to CSV / Excel
* Localized database that doesn't require an RDBMS (MySQL/MSSQL/Postgresql) install
* No web server installation required
* Based on .Net Core
